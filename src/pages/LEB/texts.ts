export const b1 = `A notable work in the Baroque style of artistic expression, Las Meninas remains Diego Velazquez' most widely known work. Depicting a complex composition of people observing and assisting princess Margaret Theresa as well looking at as the viewer of the canvas, the painting certainly isn't visually unstimulating. Using a subdued baroque color scheme, the painting includes soft textures of clothing, wood, furniture and walls.`;
export const b2 = `Leveraging the noisy and dynamic composition of this painting, Velazquez presents a comfortable and almost homely tonal blanket over the canvas. Using the visual spontaneity of the people in the canvas,  Velazquez tries to replicate the sense of being among a lively and comforting family. Within the eleven people on the frame, the individuals also include a significant amount of relationships between them. Except the princess, these figures can be grouped into overlapping groups of 2s and 3s - for instance, the king and the queen in the mirror. All of the pairs happen to include a male and a female within them - providing a visual balance and putting emphasis on the princess in the middle. In terms of threes, an example would be the group in the middle that includes both the maids and the princess. Another happens to be the two people on the right and the dog. Upon closer inspection, Velazquez' genius transcends and leaks onto the backdrop as well - as the motif of twos and threes manifests itself among the hanging paintings on the wall (two on the top, three below).`;
export const b3 = `The ambiguity in the composition further provides an interesting way to engage the viewer and form very different interpretations as a result. The focal point on first glance seems to be the bright central princess, but moves to the mirror in the back depicting the king and queen on a deeper glance. However, considering the brightness and the fact that all vanishing points lead to the doorway with the court official, it may also be seen as the central point of focus.`;
export const b4 = `My interpretation for this painting responds to the ambiguity in its composition, and the various points of focus of the painting. On first glance it seems like the mirror is reflecting the viewer, implying that the kind and queen are in the viewer's place. However, considering the perspective based focal point to be the court official, I'd argue that the king and queen are a reflection of the painting on the left. Since this was a time when notable paintings were depictions of royalty, I believe this painting critiques the place of painting in the arts as a whole. Using the ambiguous focal points, it has a conversation with the viewer about the meaning and purpose of painting itself.  Misleading the viewer into expecting the reflection to be of the king and queen directly, Velasquez shifts the focus, but doesn't let it rest. As a result, it intentionally focuses on the virtue of art itself, rather than the photorealistic and flattering depictions of royalty - to make its case for art as a whole.`;
export const b5 = `I also believe that the princess personifies the meaning of paintings, when combined with the motif of male and female pairs all across the canvas - that might convey the meaning of reproduction and life itself. Using the previous point to argue a case for art itself, this point associates art with the act of producing life itself.`;
export const b6 = `The painting exhibits a high extent of artistic maturity, and successfully creates a conversation with the viewer about what art means with its visuals. Being an incredibly complex work, La Meninas also successfully escapes an oversubtly in its expression as opposed to other notable works that include Whistler's Black No.1. Taking an approachable and meaningful approach, its successes in conveying its meanings invites the viewer to appreciate the very area of fine arts itself.`;
export const b7 = `However, although the painting's visual ambiguity is a strength in conveying its meaning, it can also be seen as a flaw in solidifying the painting's message. The high extent of divergence as a result of the ambiguous focal points undermines Velazquez' critique of the state of art in 1656. This might eventually make it less effective than it could have been, in making a change in pubic perception towards art during its time.`;
