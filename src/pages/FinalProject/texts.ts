export const f1 = `Upon opening the brief for the first time, I was instantly drawn towards the topic of “self-identity”, as during job interviews and networking sessions I always find myself describing my interests in both software engineering and design. Having explained this duality to so many people in the past, I wanted to use this project to tackle communicating this idea through a visual medium - such that I wouldn't have to explain anything.`;
export const f2 = `Similar to other assignments, I immediately had a bunch of ideas spawn in the depths of the vessel I call my brain - including a brand based around UX-related visuals (as UX is the middle ground between development and design), a neon green matrix style brand (but I thought this might be cliché), or something closer to home. Eventually, I went with a very personal idea based around what I see everyday - code editors like VSCode. Prioritizing authenticity over aesthetics, I decided to represent my own experiences and my own perspective through a visual means.`;
export const f3 = `Starting my process, I immediately had the following priorities as I figured they would be the core aspects of my brand style guide:`;
export const f4 = `As usual, my chaotic brainstorming process had me go in several tangents with divergent ideas regarding the various elements of my brand style guide. This However, throughout the brainstorming stage, I constantly asked myself:`;
export const f5 = `Eventually, my idea of a logo included the combination of semiotics and letterform - with combined symbols of a paintbrush and coding syntax to form my initial “B”. As for my business card, I wanted it to be conversational and highly interactive to the reader - such that they get persuaded to give me call, instead of archiving my card in their grandmother's closet.`;
export const f6 = `Through sheer trial and error, I deduced that an analogous color scheme of blues, purples and pinks might be the best balance between dynamism and originality (as a complementary scheme like blue and orange might be too generic for a brand).`;
export const f7 = `As for my philosophy throughout the project, I wanted a high extent of reduction to the core ideas I wanted to portray. I realized that representations or ideas can get very convoluted with this particular topic, but I wanted it to be focused on the core idea of “using code as a means to communicate and express creative design”. Being very much interested in UX design, since I believe aesthetics are a side effect of function and purpose, I didn't really focus on how things look at first — rather just wanted to focus on the ideas themselves.`;
export const f8 = `Using hand-drawn sketches to determine the proportions, positioning and sizing of my logo, I proceeded to use Illustrator to create the frame of the logo using lines to structure the proportions. Since Illustrator snaps vertices based on other vertices around, this was an easier process than I expected. I think proceeded to use the skeleton of the logo and add color to it. After several variations, I found myself preferring a version that included a gradient shape to represent the fluid mixture between my creative and logical sides - represented by two secondary colors mixing together. This further solidified the idea that it was in fact a paintbrush on the left. I also decided to remove the curve figure from the left in the picture below, to arrive at the solid shape on the right for the paint, to have a more consistent design language.`;
export const f9 = `The business card was relatively straightforward as I decided to stick closely with my original idea to increase instructiveness. Using CSS imagery at the front and Python-based code imagery on the back, it also reinforced the idea of a distinct “frontend” and a “backend” in software applications, as the two languages are used in those respective domains. Of course, aware that it might be difficult for a usual person to understand or recognize these aspects, I decided to make the visuals as approachable as possible, with only a light presence of this code imagery on either side. As a result, the business card allowed me to learn more about understanding my target audience and their characteristics to a higher degree.`;
export const f10 = `The color system used for this brand is primarily derived from the colors used in modern code editors like VSCode. However, the contrasts and saturation of code editor fonts are often exaggerated for salience — but they were reduced significantly for this color system for greater approachability and normalization for the public. I took an analogous approach rather than the complementary approach I almost took - purely because a complementary approach (e.g. blue and orange) seemed generic. In the current system, uniqueness is still prevalent, while preserving the fun visual dynamism. I also used the secondary colors pink and purple-ish blue to symbolize design and technology respectively. This is also why the gradient in the paint of my logo is a mixture of the two, as it signifies the dilution between design and technology as a part of my identity.`;
export const f11 = `As for my typography, I was initially searching around for coding language fonts to communicate the idea of code to the viewer. I soon realized that these mono-spaced fonts lack readability when compared to modern sans-serif fonts like Helvetica, Lato or Roboto. This further implied that they would not be as approachable to the general public as they can be, and might even cause fatigue in the viewer to follow along with text. Due to these reasons, I decided to create my own font completely from scratch - a lethal hybrid between mono-spaced coding fonts like Source Code Pro, and modern sans-serif like Lato.`;
export const f12 = `Using the lecture typography guidelines closely, I first leveraged a window box with guiding lines to help me structure each letter using the Pen tool. Closely studying height, spacing and kerning from other fonts on the market, I used what I saw to create something that just felt right to me for each letter in terms of distinct appearance and user-friendliness. As a result, the hybrid look was successfully achieved. Eventually, I used Illustrator's FontSelf plugin to simply compile these fonts, as Illustrator has difficulty doing it itself.`;
export const f13 = `Consistent with any process of creating complex things from scratch, the font needed several touchups after they were complete. Originally I had made the fonts purely mono-spaced, which made it difficult to read to the viewer due to its odd spacing. This was due to the fact that I was under the impression that the “coding” vibe comes only from mono-spacing the fonts. However, I realized that the vibe actually comes from mono-spacing the letters themselves, instead of the padding around them. Having mostly equidistant widths for each letter relative to each other, I decided to make the spacing more proportionally spaced to arrive at a more readable font. `;
export const f14 = `To create a bold variation of the font, I used the offset path tool to automatically thicken each letter, instead of thickening them manually (which might create inconsistencies). This sped things up, to create a much needed variation of the font to create higher hierarchy fonts for the brand.`;
export const f15 = `The infographic was a tedious process due to its experimental nature. You see, I'm tired of black and white resumes with outdated serif fonts, in boring formats - just so that they're accepted by automated ATS machines every company uses. As a cathartic release of creative fatigue, I wanted to make the infographic fun and engaging for the viewer. Upon several ideas, I eventually decided to go with an infographic route - without knowing how I'd do it. Jumping straight into Illustrator to play around with layouts, shapes and figures, I found a layout that just made sense to me in conveying my duality to the viewer. I added a timeline structure to the experiences section, and crucially divided the resume into 2 sides (design on the left and coding on the right), forming a spectrum that persisted through most of the resume. So readers can view any experience or skill and instantly recognize if it’s related to design or coding. This spectrum-split was also color coded to make it very easy to follow.`;
export const f16 = `Lastly and most importantly, the brand style guide helped me learn InDesign to a much greater extent because it's the very first time I used it for my own project. Being very intuitive, it helped me play around with different layouts and variations. I eventually decided to use a dark background to give the impression of a code editor, with visual cues and fonts that scream “software”. However, I decided to still keep this approachable to the public by lowering the contrast, and structuring the elements in a more conventional sense. Eventually turning out weirdly aesthetically pleasing, I was quite happy to learn how to use InDesign to solidify layouts to a much greater extent with this project.`;
export const f17 = `There were surprisingly less comments during the forum presentation - which I'll optimistically take as a good sign. Curie mentioned that my alignment of sub-headers under experiences and skills aligned with the colored header boxes instead of the text inside them - making it seem disbalanced. To fix this, I aligned the sub-headers to align with the text inside the header boxes instead of the boxes themselves. Another point was about the spacing and positioning of the infographics on the right side of the experiences in a more balanced way. Likewise, I decided to adjust them on both sides to appear more balanced.`;
export const f18 = `Some other inputs included swapping the pink as the dominant color due to its noticeability. I disagree with this point for two reasons. Firstly, Luminus images on the forums were compressed to make pink seem oddly more attention seeking; secondly, blue tones permeate through the entire brand, making blue the dominant shade throughout the guidelines.`;
export const f19 = `There was another point about bringing my logo to the front of the business card as it resembles an arrow to let the viewer know to “turn the logo around”. While this is a good point, I decided against this primarily as I wanted the front of the card to remove any distractions in a very reductionist way, to convey the message alone visually. Furthermore, the arrow being on the back might also signify to the reader to turn the logo to its front. `;
export const f20 = `This project has perhaps taught me the most among all the assignments in this module, in all aspects of the design process for graphic design, information design and branding. On a technical level, I find myself much more comfortable with Adobe tools as well. I shall continue to use what I've learnt in this project into the future.`;
