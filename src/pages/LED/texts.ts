export const d2 = `The first picture is a standard image with the mosque at the center to demonstrate, similar to what a usual image looks like. It clearly depicts the mosque, but feels restless due to the narrow composition and lacks any emotional appeal.`;
export const d3 = `Strategically using a contextually relevant and out-of-focus foreground, this composition leverages the difference in the color of the mosque's dome in-order to create a sense of religion and tradition in the frame. However, it lacks some of the recognition of the mosque due to the overlap from the foreground - I don't know what exactly it is using this picture.`;
export const d4 = `This image leverages the foreground strategy but also leverages a maximalist visual appetite using the sharp roofs of the buildings, to add a unique and sharp visual texture to the frame. This maximalist palette matches the sharp textures of the pillars of the mosque, and enforces the idea of establishment and history to the image. However, this image also introduces a higher level of cognitive load due to the visual noise, and lack of differentiation between the intended subject and the rest. Excuse the slight chromatic aberration.`;
export const d5 = `To combat the visual sensory overload from the previous frame and create an attention hierarchy, this image leverages a darker alley to contrast with the bright mosque dome. It uses the same level of a maximalist frame, but also retains a direction for the viewer to follow. To heighten emphasis, it also centers the mosque, and leverages leading lines caused by the buildings and the road to arrive at the bright yellow mosque at the center.`;
export const d6 = `Taking the previous tier even further, this tier leverages the rule of thirds to promote a higher sense of balance to the overall frame. Putting the mosque slightly on the right and closing up the frame in terms of surrounding buildings, this image successfully conveys a homely and inviting emotion - like the mosque might be someone's neighborhood mosque to seek solace during times of difficulty.`;
