export const e1 = `Being all upper case, the text causes some cognitive overload and appears to shout at the viewer. It provides a sense of loudness and restlessness that prevents the user from focusing on one content at a time.`;
export const e2 = `Creating further challenges in readability, the font chosen for this text might be adequate for its title, but certainly not for its body. The outlined and attention grabbing nature reinforces the cognitive overload caused by the upper case letters. Using a small font size for the body further lowers the readability in the text, as the outlined nature of each letter makes it hard to identify them at that size - as it just looks like a bunch of organized ants from a distance.`;
export const e3 = `The similarity between the title and the body undermines any sense of hierarchy within the text, and causes a lack of directionality in the text. Primarily due to the same font, this is also because the font is outlined, making it seem highly distinct and hollow in nature.`;
export const e4 = `The paragraph is also center aligned, making the start points of each line unaligned. This makes it harder for the reader to go from one line to another, as they have to identify where the next line starts every time.`;
export const e5 = `I would improve this typographic representation through improving the hierarchical relationship by changing the choice of font for the body text. Perhaps through a sans-serif typeface, I would contrast the slab serif outlined header to a greater extent. The body paragraph should further be aligned to the left for a more concrete structure to the paragraph. And lastly and most importantly, I would not make every word uppercase in the text, to reduce the sense of alert loudness and cognitive load.`;
