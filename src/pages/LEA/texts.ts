export const a1 = `The primary barriers to creativity for me personally include issues that are beyond creative blocks or inspiration. In fact, one of the main issues are having several ideas a day for projects or businesses and forgetting about them about 2 hours later, without any reminder or attempt at finishing them. Furthermore, having a serious hearing condition and synesthesia, my human perception throughout the day by default includes a potent dose of inescapable cognitive overload. Combined, these two issues are the bane of my ability to actually execute the creative ideas I imagine.`
export const a2 = `To combat these issues, this is a device that graphically reminds me of my previous ideas, while playing soothing jazz or lofi music when I enter my room to help me focus. Using engaging graphics to cycle through my ideas, I will get reminded of ideas instead of immediately forgetting them. Since music lowers the amount of distraction I have as a result of my hearing, synesthesia and the general scattered nature of my attention, the soft music will help me focus enough to actually think about executing the idea that's on the screen.`;
export const a3 = `Similar to a project I'm currently planning to code, when I enter my room - this item detects my movement using IR sensors around it. When I'm in my room and have sat down, it gently begins the music and the gentle peripheral display of my ideas on its screen. A button or voice command can be used to turn it off.`;
