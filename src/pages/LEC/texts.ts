export const c1 = `On the surface, using the signifier of freshly diced tomatoes in the shape of a Heinz ketchup bottle, this ad signifies the freshness and natural nature of the ingredients used in Heinz ketchup products.`;
export const c2 = `However, on a deeper level, Heinz successfully appeals to the contextually increased fatigue by the general public in consuming products with chemicals they can't pronounce. By directly converging naturally grown tomatoes in the shape of the ketchup, Heinz directly associates their product with natural produce, instead of artificial ingredients. Using the post-2010s concerns for processed products to its advantage, it uses this imagery to deviate from any association with market products that use artificial ingredients. The perceived freshness of the tomatoes further associate the product with the idea of good health for its consumers.`;
export const c3 = `The bottom caption further leverages the term “grow” to supplement the idea of freshness, by associating the ketchup product as a crop itself. It's also used to oppose the term “manufacture” or “produce”, which further differentiates Heinz' image from its competitors. `
